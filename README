NAME
    RT::Extension::StallFutureTicket - Stall a new ticket automatically when
    start time is set to a future date

DESCRIPTION
    This RT Extension allows to automatically stall created tickets with a
    start time in the future.

INSTALLATION
    This extension based on the following modules:

        RT >= 4.0.0
        Date::Manip >= 6.25

    To install this extension, run the following commands:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

CONFIGURATION
  RT SITE CONFIGURATION
    To enable this extension edit the RT site configuration located in
    "$RT_HOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm" (where $RT_HOME is the path to your RT
    installation):

        Set(@Plugins,qw(RT::Extension::StallFutureTicket));

    You must allow to set new tickets to "stalled":

        Set(%Lifecycles,
            default => {

                [...]

                transitions => {
                    ''       => [qw(new open resolved stalled)],
                    [...]
                }
                [...]
            }
        );

    This is just an abbreviation taken from RT's main configuration file
    under "$RT_HOME/etc/RT_Config.pm". Note the added "stalled".

    To overwrite "Date::Manip"'s default configuration you may set the
    following:

        Set(%DateManipConfig, (
            'WorkDayBeg', '9:00',
            'WorkDayEnd', '17:00', 
            #'WorkDay24Hr', '0',
            #'WorkWeekBeg', '1',
            #'WorkWeekEnd', '7'
        ));

    You can find more information about the configurable parameters under
    <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Date-Manip/lib/Date/Manip/Config.pod#BUSINE
    SS_CONFIGURATION_VARIABLES>.

    After all your new configuration will take effect after restarting your
    RT environment:

        rm -rf $RT_HOME/var/mason_data/obj/* && service apache2 restart

    This is an example for deleting the mason cache and restarting the
    Apache HTTP web server on a Debian GNU/Linux based operating system.
