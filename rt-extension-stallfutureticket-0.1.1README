RT-Extension-StallFutureTicket - Stall a new ticket automatically when
start time is set to a future date



This RT Extension allows to automatically stall created tickets with a
start time in the future.

Installation
============

Before you can install this RT Extension you must install the perl
module Date::Manip first. The easiest way is to use CPAN:

    cpan -i Date::Manip

To install this extension, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Configuration
=============

To make this extension active register it to in RT site configuration
file located in RT_HOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm where RT_HOME is the path
to your RT installation.

    Set(@Plugins,qw(RT::Extension::StallFutureTicket));

You must allow to set new tickets to 'stalled':

    Set(%Lifecycles,
        default => {

            [...]

            transitions => {
                ''       => [qw(new open resolved stalled)],
                [...]
            }
            [...]
        }
    );

This is just an abbreviation taken from RT's main configuration file
under RT_HOME/etc/RT_Config.pm`. Note the added 'stalled'.

To overwrite Date::Manip's default configuration you may set the
following:

    Set(%DateManipConfig, (
        'WorkDayBeg', '9:00',
        'WorkDayEnd', '17:00', 
        #'WorkDay24Hr', '0',
        #'WorkWeekBeg', '1',
        #'WorkWeekEnd', '7'
    ));

You can find more information about the configurable parameters under
http://search.cpan.org/~sbeck/Date-Manip-6.25/lib/Date/Manip/Config.pod#BUSINESS_CONFIGURATION_VARIABLES.

After all your new configuration will take effect after restarting your
RT environment:

    rm -rf RT_HOME/var/mason_data/obj/* && service apache2 restart

This is an example for deleting the mason cache and restarting the
Apache HTTP web server on a Debian based operating system.
